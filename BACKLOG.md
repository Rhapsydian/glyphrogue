# Glyphrogue backlog

## NEXT SESSION

The deep-dive planning roadmap is now complete (session 9, packaging, is
done — see below). Per `docs/design/build-pipeline.md`'s framing,
`packages/core` implementation was waiting on either the roadmap finishing
or an explicit decision to start earlier — the roadmap has now finished, so
the next `/dev-session` should confirm with the user whether to start
`packages/core` implementation, or whether something else takes priority
first. Don't assume implementation starts automatically; this is a decision
point, not a default.

## Deferred / future items

- **Accessible alternative/description layer for the canvas viewport** —
  the canvas game map has no screen-reader-accessible equivalent; flagged
  as a real future addon in `docs/design/ui-and-input.md`'s accessibility
  section, not designed there. Would need its own scoped session.
- **Shipped default colorblind-safe palette** —
  `docs/design/ui-and-input.md` decides palettes must be
  swappable/player-selectable but doesn't ship actual colorblind-safe
  color values (palettes are game-authored content, same as the base
  palette). Providing a default one as a convenience is future work, not
  designed there.
- **Content-pipeline story for large hand-authored world data** —
  `docs/design/build-pipeline.md` decided ordinary code-imported/
  lazy-imported JS/JSON is sufficient for maps/mods/config as designed so
  far, but a game with a very large hand-authored world may eventually
  need a real build step (splitting one big authoring file into many
  lazy-loadable chunks). Not needed by anything decided through session 8;
  would need its own scoped session if a concrete case demands it.

## Deep-dive planning roadmap

Implementation of `packages/core` doesn't start until this roadmap (or an
explicit user decision to start earlier) says it's ready to. Each session is
research-and-planning only, producing one doc under `docs/design/`. Order is
roughly dependency order (foundational pieces before things that build on
them; packaging last since it depends on everything else) — reorder/split/
merge as needed if a topic turns out bigger or smaller than expected.

1. ~~**Core architecture & game loop**~~ — done, see
   [`docs/design/core-architecture.md`](docs/design/core-architecture.md).

3. ~~**Map generation & map editor**~~ — done, see

4. ~~**Scripting & content/plugin API**~~ — done, see
   [`docs/design/scripting-api.md`](docs/design/scripting-api.md).
5. ~~**Font & glyph/tileset pipeline**~~ — done, see

6. ~~**UI/UX & input framework**~~ — done, see
   [`docs/design/ui-and-input.md`](docs/design/ui-and-input.md).
7. ~~**Build pipeline & dev/prod split**~~ — done, see
   [`docs/design/build-pipeline.md`](docs/design/build-pipeline.md).
8. ~~**Packaging & distribution**~~ — done, see
   [`docs/design/packaging.md`](docs/design/packaging.md).

After each session, check off the completed item here, link its doc, and
move the NEXT SESSION pointer to the following one.
